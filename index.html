		Over the years I have gained a lot of knowledge in a variety of fields:  <br/> 
		showcase desserts, restaurant desserts, baking bread, working with Tabon, </br>

		The content of the training was complex pastries that meet the definitions of innovation, beauty, and style.	</br>
		A fascinating training course.
